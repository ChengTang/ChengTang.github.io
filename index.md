Learning to integrate Hamiltonian Dynamics through unsupervised learning(where we have access only to the Hamiltonian) and supervised learning(where we have access to data).

A study of optimization algorithms for extremely ill-conditioned, non-convex regression problem where optimization error is crucial. A scalable second order method based on Krylov iteration that attacks the saddle point problem is found to out perform all of the popular first-order methods(e.g. gradient descent, Adam, ...) and other scalable alternatives(e.g. quasi-Newton methods, conjugate gradient method).
